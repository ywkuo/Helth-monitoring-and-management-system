1. screener.pdf shows the hardware wiring.
2. Used items: wemos d1 mini, buzzer, i2c LCD, RC522 (SPI)

// Functions:
// 1. connecting to wifi (if not, reboot)
// 2. RFID reading
// 3. query the software gateway by MQTT (will try 3 times)
//    success of publishing is confirmed by the message from software gateway
//    Remark: I only use QoS=0 because I don't have time to verify QoS=1.
// 4. Output data on LCD screen and generate a sound.
//    4 cases:
//    case 0: UID is not in the private database of NCNU
//    case 1: No temperature value corresponding to this UID today
//    case 2: Temperature is normal for this UID  
//    case 3: Over temerature for this UID
// 5. MQTT publish topic: "TEMP_CHECK"
//    payload format: {"mac":MACaddress,"id":UID}
// 6. MQTT subscribe topic: "TEMP_CHECK/device_macaddress"
//    payload format: none, just one byte (0, 1, 2, or 3)
